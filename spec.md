# Street View Runner Web App Spec

## Overview
- Build a Street View “indoor ride” where an FTMS bike drives movement. Web Bluetooth reads Indoor Bike Data and the app advances panoramas by true distance traveled.
- Cloudflare Worker stores last location and per‑day history in KV.

## Goals
- FTMS‑only BLE (service `0x1826`), subscribe to Indoor Bike Data (`0x2AD2`).
- Movement driven by total distance deltas from BLE device.
- Persist last pano `{lat,lng,heading,ts}` and path history.
- Passkey-only simple authentification.

## Non‑Goals
- Interaction between users.

## Environment
- Repo: root of this project; frontend in `public/`, Worker in `src/`.
- Runtime: Browser (Web Bluetooth secure context) + Cloudflare Workers (KV bound as `KV`, assets bound as `ASSETS`).
- Approvals/Sandbox: approvals on‑request; filesystem workspace‑write; network restricted.
- Commands: `npm run dev`, `npm run preview`, `npm run deploy`.
- Secrets: `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` via Wrangler secret; for local `.dev.vars` only.

## Interfaces

### Routes (Worker)
- GET `/api/status?userId=…`
  - 200 `{ ok: true, status: { lat:number, lng:number, heading:number, ts:number } }`
  - 400 if `userId` missing.
- POST `/api/status`
  - Body `{ userId:string, location:{ lat:number, lng:number, heading?:number } }`
  - 200 `{ ok: true }`; 400 on invalid/missing fields.
- GET `/api/history?userId=…&day=YYYY-MM-DD`
  - 200 `{ ok: true, items: Array<{ lat,lng,heading,ts }> }`; day defaults to today.
- POST `/api/history`
  - Body `{ userId:string, point:{ lat:number, lng:number, heading?:number, ts?:number, day?:string } }`
  - 200 `{ ok: true }`; trims to last 500 items per day; 400 on invalid input.
- Errors: 405 Method Not Allowed with `Allow` header for wrong method.

### BLE (FTMS)
- Service: Fitness Machine Service `0x1826`.
- Characteristic: Indoor Bike Data `0x2AD2` (notifications enabled).
- Movement source of truth: total_distance delta between consecutive notifications. Handle counter reset/wrap by treating negative deltas as zero.
- Don't modify _parseIndoorBikeData() function.

### UI
- The main content is Street View Panorama by Google Maps, with overlaying mini map.
- Top of the screeen
  - It shows s speed meter (km/h) and and an odmeter (km) which shows traveled distance for the day.
  - BLE connect button is shown when and only no BLE device is connected. 
- Side Pane: following elements are show in a pane that is collapsable and hidden in default.
  - Status: Device name, active service, connection status; sensor metrics: speed (km/h), cadence (rpm), distance (m).
- Interactions: choose forward link closest to current heading;  auto‑align POV to link heading when turn >45°.
- "Turn!" notify toast and beep to request the user to choose direction.

## Data Model / Storage (KV)
- Keys:
  - `status:v1:{userId}` → `{ lat, lng, heading, ts }` (JSON)
  - `history:v1:{userId}:{YYYY-MM-DD}` → `Array<{ lat, lng, heading, ts }>`
- Constraints: trim history arrays to 500 items; no TTL required by default.

## Behavior
- On auth (startup)
  - Auto login (never expire)
  - if failed, request user to register using passkey only (no password).
    - user id is auto generated by uuidv4 and hidden to the user (user do not enter user-id).
    - default readable username is auto generated in some way. user can change it on the registering process
- On login
  - load daily distance for the user.
  - load today's history and put marker on mini map.
- On BLE `characteristicvaluechanged` event, parsing each event, and when total_distance delta from previous one > 0 
  - update metrics and UI
  - advance (in pano), that will triger `links_changed` envet followed by `position_changed` event.
    - If required turn angle >80°: 
       - Don't advance and notify the user to choose direction.
       - if Audio: beep. throttle beeps to ≥250 ms apart.
    - measure
- On Maps `links_changed` envet
  - further advance if there still are distance to go
- On Maps `position_changed` event
  - persist location every ≥10 m.

## Security
- Validate `userId`, `lat`, `lng`, and numeric types server‑side.
- Do not expose secrets; inject Google Maps key via HTMLRewriter at runtime.
- Web Bluetooth requires HTTPS/localhost secure context; no cross‑origin BLE access.

## Performance
- Browser budget: single AudioContext, minimal allocations per notification.
- Worker: KV interactions are small JSON payloads; cap history size; avoid large responses.

## Telemetry / Logging
- Worker logs request method/path; logs API errors with message.
- Frontend may log BLE connection status changes and warnings when Maps API missing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Connecting to an FTMS bike updates cadence (rpm), speed (km/h), and distance (m) in the UI.
- Movement advances Street View driven by total_distance deltas.
- `/api/status` and `/api/history` behave exactly as specified; inputs validated, history trimmed to 500.
- No RSC/CSC code in the codebase; BLE filters FTMS only.
- Resource usage remains stable (no `net::ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES`).

## Test Plan (Manual)
1) `npm run dev` and open `http://127.0.0.1:8787` over a secure context.
2) Connect an FTMS bike; verify device/service labels, cadence rpm, speed km/h, distance m updating.
3) Enable auto‑advance; confirm “Turn!” alerts on sharp turns.
4) History persists in KV (refresh and resume last position and day's history).
5) Inspect Worker logs for API requests; verify 400/405 behaviors for invalid input/methods.

## Deliverables
- Frontend: `public/app.js`, `public/index.html` (labels as needed), audio + rate limiting.
- Worker: `src/index.js` with `/api/status` and `/api/history` + HTML key injection.
- Docs: this spec at `/spec.md`.

## Rollout / Backout
- nothing now.
